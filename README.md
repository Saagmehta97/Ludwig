# ludwig README

Ludwig VS is a VS Code extension that makes writing accessible HTML easier for developers. Ludwig offers in-line highlights, errors, and recommendations to make HTML more accessible . 

One sixth of the world will become permanently or temporarily disabled in their lifetime, but 98% of websites suffer from inaccessibility issues. Ludwig tackles this problem head-on by being a tool that devs can trust during the development process, rather than waiting to run accessibility tests after the fact. Ludwig highlights accessibility errors in real-time such as missing aria-attributes or empty tags. Its pop-ups display the root issue and provide further documentation for developers. Our Ludwig panel allows devs to see a comprehensive overview of the errors in their HTML and provides a custom accessibility score for reference. 

Ludwig boasts coverage for over 85 of the most critical and common accessibility guidelines. We are still developing our coverage for all guidelines as well as JSX. If you or someone you know would like to contribute to Ludwig, please reach out to us!
